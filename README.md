# Sivapriya-JuMP

This project is developed as part of the **JuMP** initiative under the guidance of **Sanober Sarfaraz** and the **ACM-W** (Association for Computing Machinery - Women) chapter.

## Project Overview

This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict the severity of forest fires based on environmental factors like temperature, humidity, wind, and rainfall. It utilizes the **Forest Fires Dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and applies feature engineering, **XGBoost** regression, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve an optimized prediction model.

Additionally, a **Streamlit** app is developed to allow users to interact with the model and predict the potential burned area based on custom input values.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Log transformation to handle skewed target variable.
- Model building using **XGBoost Regressor**.
- Hyperparameter tuning using **RandomizedSearchCV**.
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score.
- **Streamlit Web App** for easy model interaction and prediction.
- Deployment-ready code.
